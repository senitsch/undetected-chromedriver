# Undetected Chromedriver with ARM support #

## Description ##
This fork combines version 3.5.3 of undetected chromedriver
https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver
with ARM support from
https://github.com/ArevomEisvolk/undetected-chromedriver
(which was still based on v3.1.2 when creating this fork).

My goal was to make the newest version of undetected chromedriver available for raspberry.
